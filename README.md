# mllaunchpad-template
Template for creating a Python Machine Learning Project that uses ML Launchpad.

The use case tackled here is https://github.com/schuderer/mllaunchpad/issues/60: deploying on a vanilla Linux machine from a different Windows/Linux machine.

While useful tools and technologies (think CI, setuptools, Docker, etc.) are out of scope for the issue above, template repositories for those use cases are very welcome!

When using this template, please replace the contents of this file with a description of your application.
